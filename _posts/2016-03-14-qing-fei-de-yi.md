He first met Olivia at the University's swimming pool. He had a whole lane by himself and enjoyed some 22 spacious laps, when she appeared and asked if it's ok to join his lane. He said ok and ended up swimming circles with her until he had cramps in both legs.

"How are you holding up?" She asked.
"Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional." He grined.
"Hmm..., that's deep." She said, "I wonder where you got that."
"Inspired by your legs. They are great."

That night, he learned those legs are the result of 15 years hard training. He also learned she has read the pain-and-suffering quote from the running book by Murakami.

"Beware of great legs. They'll get you every time." His dad once told him that. Like his dad, he is a hopelessly superficial person. But occassionally, things of quality would strike the core of his Self, and he'd feel an urge of going to the graveyard, deep in the forest, and digging. That pair of legs of Olivia's had that kind of quality.

He used to caress those legs while she's giving him head. And when he's about to come, he'd grab her ankle and squeeze her feet. She gave really good head.

These days, he still swims a mile everyday, and sleeps like a baby. But once in a while, he'd wake up in the middle of the night, and wonder how he let those legs swim away.
