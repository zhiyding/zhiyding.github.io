When the night has come    
And the land is dark    
And the moon is the only light we'll see    
No I won't be afraid    
No I won't be afraid    
Just as long as you stand, stand by me    
And darling, darling stand by me    
Oh, stand by me    
Oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me        
If the sky that we look upon    
Should tumble and fall    
And the mountains should crumble to the sea    
I won't cry, I won't cry    
No I won't shed a tear    
Just as long as you stand, stand by me    
And darling, darling stand by me    
Oh, stand by me    
Oh stand, stand by me, stand by me
