Don't worry about a thing    
Cause every little thing gonna be alright    

Singing Don't worry about a thing    
Cause every little thing gonna be alright!    

Rise up this morning    
Smiled with the rising sun    
Three little birds    
Pitch by my doorstep    
Singing sweet songs    
Of melodies pure and true    
Saying, "This is my message to you"
