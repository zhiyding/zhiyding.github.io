Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing gonna be alright

Singing Don't worry about a thing
Cause every little thing gonna be alright!

Rise up this morning
Smiled with the rising sun
Three little birds
Pitch by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Saying, "This is my message to you"
